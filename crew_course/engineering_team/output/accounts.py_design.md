# Detailed Design for Account Management System Module

## Module Name: `accounts.py`

This module is designed to handle basic account management for a trading simulation platform. The functionalities include creating accounts, managing funds, executing trades, calculating portfolio value, and generating reports on holdings and transactions.

### Class: `Account`

This class represents a user's account in the trading simulation platform and provides methods to manage the account's operations.

#### Methods

1. **`__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`**
   - Initializes a new account with a unique `account_id` and an `initial_deposit` of funds.

2. **`deposit(self, amount: float) -> bool`**
   - Allows users to deposit additional funds into their account.
   - Returns `True` if the deposit is successful, `False` otherwise.

3. **`withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`**
   - Allows users to withdraw funds from their account.
   - Prevents withdrawal if it would result in a negative balance.
   - Returns `True` if the withdrawal is successful, `False` otherwise.

4. **`buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`**
   - Records a transaction where the user buys a specified quantity of shares for a given stock symbol.
   - Utilizes `get_share_price(symbol)` to get the current price of each share.
   - Ensures the user has sufficient funds to make the purchase.
   - Returns `True` if the purchase is successful, `False` otherwise.

5. **`sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`**
   - Records a transaction where the user sells a specified quantity of shares for a given stock symbol.
   - Verifies that the user possesses enough shares to sell.
   - Returns `True` if the sale is successful, `False` otherwise.

6. **`get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`**
   - Calculates the total current value of the user's portfolio using `get_share_price(symbol)` for valuation.
   - Returns the total portfolio value in currency.

7. **`get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`**
   - Calculates the profit or loss based on the initial deposit and current portfolio value.
   - Returns the net profit or loss as a float.

8. **`get_holdings_report(self) -> dict`**
   - Provides a report of the user's current share holdings with quantities for each stock symbol.
   - Returns a dictionary with stock symbols as keys and quantities as values.

9. **`get_transaction_history(self) -> list`**
   - Lists all transactions (buys and sells) that the user has conducted over time.
   - Returns a list of transaction records, each detailing the type of transaction, stock symbol, quantity, and timestamp.

10. **`get_share_price(self, symbol: str) -> float`**
    - A placeholder method illustrating the module's interaction with this external function.
    - Returns the fixed share price for a given stock symbol.

### Usage Example

Here is an outline of how the `Account` class can be used within the `accounts.py` module:

```python
# Example usage
account = Account(account_id="user123", initial_deposit=1000.00)
account.deposit(500.00)
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 5)
account.sell_shares("AAPL", 2)
account.withdraw(200.00)
print(account.get_portfolio_value())
print(account.get_profit_or_loss())
print(account.get_holdings_report())
print(account.get_transaction_history())
```

This detailed design outlines the proposed functionality and classes for the account management system, preparing it for implementation and testing.
